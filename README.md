# Eazy Pariksha

> A Multi-platform exam portal app, built using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM). Biggest highlight was shifting ViewModel to the shared module, alongside writing entire UI in Jetpack Compose (0 XML files, no dependencies from `androidx.appcompat`)

## What is shared?
* Data Layer
* Domain Models
* StateHolder (ViewModel)

## What is native?
* UI Layer
